#PyWin-Speak

Python TTS using win32com.client.

## Example Usage
You can simply just put speech.py in the directory or your project and `import speech`.
After you have imported it, you can run speech.say() to speak inputed vars or strings. Example: `speech.say("Hello, World!")`
Alteratively, you can put speech.py in your Python Lib (C:\Python27\Lib) folder and call 'import speech' just like normal. This elivates the need to have speech.py in all of your projects directories.
